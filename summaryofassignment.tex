%the intial conditions that were given as h=0.2 and L=0.1 however this is a very small domain for the flow and as the boundaries are too close the fluid solution will be corrupted by these /boundary conditions easily so for reducing these errors i have chosen to increse the domain length by doing this im first investigating where the fluid's boundary layer is fully developed and plotting the velocity profile of it as it doesnt change after that point so whatever length after that point is just a computational waste so im increasing the length to 10m and reduced the length(x) for the other runs.

%as i changed the length from 10m to 2m with same number of cells the area of cell has reduced thus the stability of the system has reduced drastically and now it takes alot of time to compute on coupled scheme
