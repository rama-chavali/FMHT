The contour shows that the profile is not totally formed and the graph shows that it still needs to be converged so the initial geometry was 
extended with O(2) to check where it converges for changing height is not a valid choice to keep the velocity same I have increased the 
length of the channel to 10m. The mesh size is 20x40 !its always written in XxYxZ.
